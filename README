=          Design           =
=============================
my whole class sits under the fileprocessing
    exceptions -  all exceptions sit in there own package so any time we reach for an
    exception they are all put together giving me the option latter to reuse them in a different project
    filter -  filters sit in there own package made to be used in further projects the package comes with a
    factory of a singleton type and a reversing type to reverse the effect of the filter
    Orders - orders sit in there own package each order comes of the comparator type making it easier to
    order so for future use we can use them on javas own sorting algorithms it comes with a factory to create
    a filter to be used
    orders - all orders will sit in there own package for further uses they have a factory to create a oder
    they are of type comparator<Path> made to compare to sort them all by a certain factor
    toolboxes - they are classes designed specifically to help us with side problems they will many times
    find errors for us and raise them
    DirectoryProcsesor - a main class to receive the arguments and run the whole function
    FilterAndFileOrder - this class is made for filtering and ordering the list of subsections that
    i received and printing them out in the correct order and sorted and prints the correct errors
    parseData - a class made to parse the data received from the file that user want us to parse by
    subsectionHolder - a class meant to hold sub sections of the command file

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
    exceptions - all exceptions inherit from the exception class but are split into two categories
    typeOne and typeTwo each one representing a different type of error
    filters - all filters are children of the Filter<Path> interface putting them in the decorator design
    while creating a certain filter for the type of sorting all of the inheriting classes decorate the
    parent class the only difference of filters is the size filters since the implementations are so
    different they implement an interface instead. there is a factory of a singleton type to create a filter
    orders - all inherit from the comparator<Path> using the decorator design to add on and implement there
    own function of compare there is a reverse compare to reverse the effect of a certain compare and a
    factory of a singleton type exists to create factories
    toolboxes - the are all put in there own package and of singleton type since that is the part of the
    toolbox design they are put in there own package for future uses of the toolboxes and expanding
    especially Sort which can get more types of sorting in the future
    DirectoryProccesor - creates instances of the of the objects to parse and then filter out the data
    FilterAndFileOrder - this class has three function one to get the filter one filters filters it one to
    get the order and order it by calling the sorting function tool box
    Parse data - this class will read file lines and parse them into sub sections so we can filter the
    files in a much simpler way
    subsectionholder - this class receives data about the certain sub section we are dealing with
    giving us an object that is easy to work with when we need to actually analyze a certain section
    this object comes very useful for finding simple information about the object

=    Answers to questions   =
=============================
1. why did i choose quick sort?
it is a very easy sort to implement its expectancy is nlog(n) and it sorts on the spot instead of
creating new arrays and sorting them saving memory space when it comes to big amounts of files
2. the hierarchy i choose to deal with my exceptions was that the toolboxes would throw my exceptions
which either the factory raised towards the parser or filterandorders type two exceptions got raised all
the way to the main stop the program from running and type one exceptions were handled in the filters and
orders class and dealt with there by using default values i choose this design so that if its a type
two error it would stop the system and a type one error would know how to take care of it and
continue running
3. i sorted the match files using quick sort my answer for why i used it is explained above
i used the data structure of array list since it has dynamic size  on the one hand and on the
other hand it is vey easy to accesses a value in a certain location
